### Hi there and welcome ðŸ‘‹

I have loved data and data analytics for many years and formalised this with a Master of Data Science late last year (and subsequently got a job as a Data Scientist). I am passionate about continuing to learn as much as I can about data science, and helping others in the field. I may not upload new content to my profile often, but there's always something in the works.

I know Python, R, a fair amount of SQL and how to use Power BI.

Some of the projects I'm currently working on are:
- learning isolation forests in anomaly detection
- learning about causal forests
- an unsupervised learning project
