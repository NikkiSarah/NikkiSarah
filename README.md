### Hi there and welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm a practicing data scientist with a tertiary qualification. I am passionate about continuing to learn as much as I can about data science, and helping others in the field. I may not upload new content to my profile often, but there's always something in the works.

I'm very competent in Python and R, know a fair amount of SQL and how to use Power BI and git. I typically prefer working in an IDE over a notebook unless the need requires, and am starting to appreciate the simplicity of a virtualised/cloud environments when the set-up is tricky on my local machine (e.g. spark).
