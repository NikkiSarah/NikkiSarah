### Hi there and welcome ðŸ‘‹

I have enjoyed data analytics for many years and formalised this with a Master of Data Science in 2022 (and subsequently got myself a job as a Data Scientist). I am passionate about continuing to learn as much as I can about data science, and helping others in the field. I may not upload new content to my profile often, but there's always something in the works.

I'm very competent in Python and R, know a fair amount of SQL and how to use Power BI and git.
